# CPTR 142 Project III: Hole in the wall game

## Problem Definition

The goal for this project is to build a game where the user moves a space on the
grid so that it matches a randomly placed similar shape or symbol. It will 
provide different difficulties based how much time you have to move your shape.
Each level that you pass will speed the next level up. You will be moved to the
next level until you don't get the symbol to the correct place. Then a message
telling how many levels you passed will be desplayed. Once you press any key you
would be taken back to the menu.
