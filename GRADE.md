# CPTR 142: Project III

## Proposal
* I like it. Just remember to capitalize and spellcheck for professionality.

## Specifications
* I recommend the browser-based "draw.io" for UML diagrams and flow charts.
* Good class division, way to keep it simple.
* Formatting could be a bit better, though that comes with knowing Markdown's syntax.
* Keep professionality in mind - capitalize and such.
* "branching and comminting changes - please help us professor"
    * Nice. You'll gain proficiency with Git as you go. A cheat sheet of Git commands might help.
* Try to have a timeline, it may help with sticking to project deadlines.
